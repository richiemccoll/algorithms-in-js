# Problem

Test if a given word is a palindrome.

A palindrome s a word or phrase that when reversed spells the same thing forwards or backwards. A simple example is mum, when you reverse the letters, it spells the same thing.

Another example of a palindrome is race car. When we take out anything that is not a character it becomes racecar which is the same spelled forwards or backwards!

Once we have determined whether it is a palindrome or not we want to return either true or false based on our findings.
