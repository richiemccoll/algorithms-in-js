# Problem

Given a set of numbers, calculate the mean, median and mode of those numbers and return the result as an object.

```
{
  mean: ...
  median: ...
  mode: ...
}
```

Here's a little poem to remember what mean, median and mode are.

```
Hey diddle diddle,
The median is the middle
You add and divide for the mean
The mode is the one that appears the most
And the range is the difference in between
```
