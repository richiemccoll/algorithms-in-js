# Problem

Given a set of numbers and a number, calculate the pairs of numbers from the set that add up to the number.
The challenge is to find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given S.

This problem is a variation of the Subset sum problem (reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem.)
