# Problem

The Caesar Cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encrypting a message. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (which in cryptography is called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters shifted up or down in the alphabet.

For each letter of the alphabet, you would take its position in the alphabet, say 3 for the letter 'C', and shift it by the key number. If we had a key of +3, that 'C' would be shifted down to an 'F' - and that same process would be applied to every letter in the plaintext.
