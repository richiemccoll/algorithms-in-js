# Problem

The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days. For example, if the given array is {32, 46, 26, 38, 40, 48, 42}, the maximum profit that can be earned is 22. This is when you buy on day 3 (26) and sell on day 6 (48).
